# Divi
Divi provides users with a platform to track expenses and payments with their household, roommates, friends, or other groups. Simply create a group, add members, and you're ready to go! 

Expenses are automatically divided between all group members, so you don't need to any calculations. If you accidentally overpay, Divi will track that too!
